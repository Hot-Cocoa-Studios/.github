# Hello!

We're **Hot Cocoa Studios**, an indie game dev studio of a few members of various different skills. Our goal is to create _high quality_ video games for low prices that can run on low-end or mid-range hardware while still looking **amazing**! 

We are working on innovative and fun games using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/), a free and open source, and very capable game engine.

We also have wonderful ways for you to play and engage with our community and team, such as:
